# EndiHaxhi-TheNemesisTest1

Hello there!
Hope you enjoy the project.
For a brief run-down, check this video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj9AjYhjy2U

The project has been documented with code thorougly. If there is any question, 
you can email me here:
endi24haxhi@hotmail.com

As a side note, when I cloned the project to test if it opened, by default it opened a bug-fix branch.
Don't forget to checkout main before you open the project with Unity!
If the error somehow still occurs, email me.

Link to builds, a zipped version of the project, and some UI assets that I made:
